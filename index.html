    <h1>Welcome to FirstRepository</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>This is FirstRepository. It's not much (right now, it's only two files), and it was never meant to be much. This is an example HTML page.</p>
    <br>
    <h3>The Purpose of FirstRepository</h3>
    <p>The purpose of FirstRepository is simply to mess around (as I am new to FitHub, but not new to programming). I eventually want to show this to friends who are also aiming to use GitHub.</p>
    <h3>Future Intentions of FirstRepository</h3>
    <p>There is no real intention of FirstRepository, other than my personal amusement, and the future goal of teaching friends. There will probably be nothing done in the future to FirstRepository, if it is not deleted.</p>
    <h3>Current Files in FirstRepository</h3>
    <p>There are only two files in FirstRepository, including this one. It will probably be expanded to have many other files, but as of now, the only other file is <a href="README.md">README.md</a>.</p>
